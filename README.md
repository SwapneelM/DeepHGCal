DeepHGCal 
==================

Based on the DeepJetCore framework (https://github.com/DL4Jets/DeepJetCore) [CMS-AN-17-126] for HGCal reconstruction purposes.

The framework consists of two parts:
1) HGCal ntuple converter (Dependencies: root5.3/6)
2) DNN training/evaluation (Dependencies: DeepJetCore and all therein).
   
The DeepJetCore framework and the DeepHGCal framework should be checked out to the same parent directory.
Before usage, always set up the environment by sourcing XXX_env.sh
